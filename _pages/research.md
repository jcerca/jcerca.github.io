I am an evolutionary biologist with a background on ecology and genomics. During the last few years I have developed an interest in Evolution in Islands and in using Genomic tools to understand these.

### Island Evolution - *Tetragnatha* ### 
I have been working with the Hawai'ian *Tetragnatha* adaptive radiation'i together with [Professor Rosemary Gillespie at Berkeley](https://nature.berkeley.edu/evolab/). These spiders have repeatedly evolved four ecomorphs in different islands ("green", which sits on leaves; "maroon", which is mostly on moss; "small brown", among twigs; and "large brown", on tree bark). Basically, an ecomorph "jumps" to a new island and re-evolves the remaining ecomorphs, as Hawai'ian Islands are created by volcanic activity.
Our goal is to determine areas on the genome responsible responsible for the adaptation of the ecomorphs to different environments.

### Island Evolution - Sparrows ###
This project is pretty fresh. I am seeking funding, together with [Dr. Mark Ravinet at Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/cells-organisms-and-molecular-genetics/people/mark.ravinet) to work on biogeography and adaptation of Cape Verde endemic Sparrows. We're still working out the funding!

### Genomics ###
I'm interested in genomics, that is studying whole genomes of organisms. I'm currently sitting on some projects on population genomics of Cichlid fishes, Genomes of Spiders and genetics of Norwegian Bowhead Whales. Unfortunately, genomics projects take some time to get moving.. so hopefully sooner than later I'll have more to talk about!

### Cryptic species ###
Cryptic species are morphologically similar species. I did my PhD with [Torsten H. Struck in Oslo](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/about/organization/research-collections/people/torsths/), where we investigated the lineage history of species which have been morphologically identical for >100 million years! It is a pretty cool topic! You can see our [lengthy review here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534717302902), as well as where we [describe some new species](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790319303975), and [where we suggest a pattern of deceleration of morphological evolution!](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/evo.13884)
