My research can be broadly organized into four questions:
## How do species adapt to (strikingly) different environments?
To answer this question I focus on island adaptive radiations. An adaptive radiation is " a process in which organisms diversify rapidly from an ancestral species into a multitude of new forms, particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available, alters biotic interactions or opens new environmental niches" (Wikipedia). On islands we observe closely related species and sister species withstanding very different environmental conditions - for instance, we observe two closely-related plants living in sun-exposed lava rocks or in the humid-highlands where there are permanent foggy conditions. How is this achieved?

Biological systems:
### *Scalesia* Comparative genomics (Galápagos) ###
As part of [DarwinPlants](http://darwin-plants.com/), I am studying the genomic-basis of insular evolution. The *Scalesia* lineage comprises >15 species distribured over coastal-arid, humid-highlands in the Galápagos. This involves obtaining reference genomes, comparing genomes, transposable elements, genes, transcriptome-networks.

## How do species repeatedly adapt to the same environments?
### *Tetragnatha* Population genomics (Hawai'i) ### 
I am working on the repeated basis of phenotypic evolution (parallel/convergent evolution) of the Hawaiian *Tetragnatha* adaptive radiation. These spiders have repeatedly evolved four ecomorphs in different islands (green, which sits on leaves; maroon, which is moss-dwelling; small brown, living in twigs and branches; and large brown, living on tree bark). 
Question: What is the genomic-basis of repeated phenotypic evolution?

## How do species evolve on islands?
Answering this question involves studying biogeography, population-connectivity and differentiation (popgen!), and species/population relatedness (phylogenetics).

Biological systems:
### Galápagos Prickly pears Population genomics ###
In this collaboration with Felipe Zapata, John McCormack, Jaime Chaves, Gonzalo Rivas-Torres (and others), we're studying the evolutionary history of Galápagos cacti. Closely related populations are phenotypically trees (12 meters tall) or very small shrubs. The prickly pears just have so much variation in terms of diversity, variation, and we're only starting.
Question: Is the Opuntia lineage undergoing an adaptive radiation on the Galápagos?

### Galápagos lava lizards ###
Collaboration starting with Juan Manuel Guayasamin (and others) - still getting off the ground.
Question: Are lava lizards undergoing ecological speciation?

## How are humans influencing the evolution of biodiversity?
Humans have a pervasive impact on biodiversity. I am interested in understanding how species can evolve to cope with human activities and within the context of human environments.

### Cape verde endemic sparrows ###
Together with [Dr. Mark Ravinet at Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/cells-organisms-and-molecular-genetics/people/mark.ravinet), we are working on the adaptation to human and wild conditions in the Cape Verde endemic sparrow species.


### Past Research ###
### Cryptic species ###
Cryptic species are morphologically similar species. I did my PhD with [Torsten H. Struck in Oslo](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/about/organization/research-collections/people/torsths/), where we investigated the lineage history of species which have been morphologically identical for >100 million years! It is a pretty cool topic, and you can see our [lengthy review here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534717302902), as well as where we [describe some new species](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790319303975), and [where we suggest a pattern of deceleration of morphological evolution!](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/evo.13884)


Collaborators
----
My approach to research consists in mobility and collaboration, benefiting from the direct expertise of leaders in different research fields, thus increasing the quality of my work and publications. This approach is highly cooperative, and is grounded on two ideas: "two brains think better than one" and "if you have worked in a topic for longer than I, it's likely that you have something to say about my ideas, result or approach". My work would thus not be possible without the knowledge, support, kindness and patience of multiple individuals.
