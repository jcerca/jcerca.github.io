I am an evolutionary biologist with a background in ecology and genomics. During the last few years I have developed an interest in island biology and in using genomic tools to understand evolution in island-lineages.

### Island Evolution - *Scalesia* ###
I am currently employed on the [DarwinPlants project](http://darwin-plants.com/). I am responsible for analysing genome evolution in the *Scalesia* genome (comparing to other Asteraceae), determine transcriptome-networks, the evolutionary history of the group, and analyse transposable element variation. Stay tuned!

### Island Evolution - *Tetragnatha* ### 
I have been working with the Hawai'ian *Tetragnatha* adaptive radiation'i together with [Professor Rosemary Gillespie at Berkeley](https://nature.berkeley.edu/evolab/). These spiders have repeatedly evolved four ecomorphs in different islands (green, which sits on leaves; maroon, which is moss-dwelling; small brown, living in twigs and branches; and large brown, living on tree bark). Basically, ecomorphs have repeatedly evolved, as Hawai'ian Islands are created by volcanic activity.
Our goal is to determine areas on the genome responsible responsible for the adaptation of the ecomorphs to different environments; and to study spider genome evolution.

### Island Evolution - Sparrows ###
This project is pretty fresh. I am seeking funding, together with [Dr. Mark Ravinet at Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/cells-organisms-and-molecular-genetics/people/mark.ravinet) to work on biogeography and adaptation of Cape Verde endemic Sparrows. While we're working out the funding we have generated some exciting population-level genomic data. To be continued.

### Cryptic species ###
Cryptic species are morphologically similar species. I did my PhD with [Torsten H. Struck in Oslo](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/about/organization/research-collections/people/torsths/), where we investigated the lineage history of species which have been morphologically identical for >100 million years! It is a pretty cool topic! You can see our [lengthy review here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534717302902), as well as where we [describe some new species](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790319303975), and [where we suggest a pattern of deceleration of morphological evolution!](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/evo.13884)


Collaborators
----
My approach to research consists in mobility and collaboration, benefiting from the direct expertise of leaders in different research fields, thus increasing the quality of my work and publications. This approach is highly cooperative, and is grounded on two ideas: "two brains think better than one" and "if you have worked in a topic for longer than I, it's likely that you have something to say about my ideas, result or approach". My work would thus not be possible without the knowledge, support, kindness and patience of multiple individuals.
