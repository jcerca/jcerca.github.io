My research can be broadly organized into three questions:
## How do species adapt to (strikingly) different environments?
To answer this question I focus on island adaptive radiations. An adaptive radiation is " a process in which organisms diversify rapidly from an ancestral species into a multitude of new forms, particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available, alters biotic interactions or opens new environmental niches" (Wikipedia). On islands we observe closely related species and sister species withstanding very different environmental conditions - for instance, we observe two closely-related plants living in sun-exposed lava rocks or in the humid-highlands where there are permanent foggy conditions. How is this achieved?

Some examples of work:
##### Island Evolution - *Scalesia* #####
I am currently employed on the [DarwinPlants project](http://darwin-plants.com/). I am responsible for analysing genome evolution in the *Scalesia* genome (comparing to other Asteraceae), determine transcriptome-networks, the evolutionary history of the group, and analyse transposable element variation. Stay tuned!
Questions: What is the genomic-basis of the plant island syndrome? Are transposable elements contributing to the observed morphological/ecological diversity in this lineage?

### Island Evolution - *Tetragnatha* ### 
I work with the Hawaiian *Tetragnatha* adaptive radiation'i together with [Professor Rosemary Gillespie at Berkeley](https://nature.berkeley.edu/evolab/). These spiders have repeatedly evolved four ecomorphs in different islands (green, which sits on leaves; maroon, which is moss-dwelling; small brown, living in twigs and branches; and large brown, living on tree bark). Basically, ecomorphs have repeatedly evolved, as Hawai'ian Islands are created by volcanic activity.
Questions: What is the genomic-basis of repeated phenotypic evolution?

### How do species evolve on islands?
### How are humans influencing the evolution of biodiversity?


### Island Evolution - Sparrows ###
Together with [Dr. Mark Ravinet at Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/cells-organisms-and-molecular-genetics/people/mark.ravinet), we are working on the biogeography and adaptation to urban and arid conditions in the Cape Verde endemic sparrow species.
Questions: What is the genomic basis of arid and urban evolution?

### Island Evolution - Galápagos Prickly pears ###
In this collaboration with Felipe Zapata, Jaime Chaves, Gonzalo Rivas-Torres (and others), we're using RADseq to study the evolutionary history of these impressive cacti. The prickly pears just have so much variation in terms of diversity, variation, and we're only starting.
Question: Is the Opuntia lineage undergoing an adaptive radiation on the Galápagos?

### Island Evolution - Galápagos lava lizards ###
Collaboration starting with Juan Manuel Guayasamin (and others) - still getting off the ground, but it'll be cool to look at these impressive Galápagos beasts!
Question: Are lava lizards undergoing ecological speciation?

### Past Research ###
### Cryptic species ###
Cryptic species are morphologically similar species. I did my PhD with [Torsten H. Struck in Oslo](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/about/organization/research-collections/people/torsths/), where we investigated the lineage history of species which have been morphologically identical for >100 million years! It is a pretty cool topic, and you can see our [lengthy review here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534717302902), as well as where we [describe some new species](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790319303975), and [where we suggest a pattern of deceleration of morphological evolution!](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/evo.13884)


Collaborators
----
My approach to research consists in mobility and collaboration, benefiting from the direct expertise of leaders in different research fields, thus increasing the quality of my work and publications. This approach is highly cooperative, and is grounded on two ideas: "two brains think better than one" and "if you have worked in a topic for longer than I, it's likely that you have something to say about my ideas, result or approach". My work would thus not be possible without the knowledge, support, kindness and patience of multiple individuals.
