General genomics (sequencing, lib prep, extraction)
------
* [Info on Pacbio's Sequel II](https://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/Overview-Sequel-Systems-Application-Options-and-Sequencing-Recommendations.pdf)
* [Extracting long-read DNA for Pacbio](https://extractdnaforpacbio.com/)
* Starting with Genomics, unix and programming? Look no further, Ming Tang has compiled [a comprehensive list of resources](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/getting-started-with-genomics-tools-and-resources)
* Sequence [file formats](https://snipcademy.com/sequence-file-formats)

Population Genomics
------
* PCA, STRUCTURE, SNAPP - [Some of my scripts](https://github.com/jcerca/population_genomics)
* ABBA-BABA [synthesis and plot](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dereneaton/ipyrad/blob/master/tests/cookbook-abba-baba.ipynb)
* List of tutorials in speciation genomics by [Mark Ravinet and Joana Meier](https://speciationgenomics.github.io/)
* List of programs in populations genomics [using genomic-level data](http://methodspopgen.com/)
* List of tutorials included [Evomics course on Speciation and Population Genomics 2016 and 2018 tutorials - including ABBA-BABA, FasSimCoal, PCA, STRUCTURE](http://evomics.org/learning/population-and-speciation-genomics/)
* SNP-filtering tutorial [by Jonathan Puritz](https://www.ddocent.com/filtering/)
* Book on population genomics with [code and exercises](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-0716-0199-0)
* Have not yet tested, but maybe a practical way to [run D-statistics from a VCF](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/634477v2)

Comparative Genomics
------
* Long-read sequencer [comparison](https://github.com/rrwick/Long-read-assembler-comparison)
* CAFE tutorial [for gene family evolution](https://iu.app.box.com/v/cafetutorial-files)

Phylogenomics
------
* List of tutorials on phylogenetic inference [by Michael Matschiner](https://github.com/mmatschiner/tutorials)
* Tutorials on phylogenomics included in the [Evomics course 2016 and 2018 tutorials](http://evomics.org/learning/phylogenetics/)
* Really good [tree handling and plotting examples](https://yulab-smu.github.io/treedata-book/)

RNA-Seq
-------
* Mind-blowing list of RNA-seq [methods, tools, pitfalls, tutorials, pipelines, packages](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/RNA-seq-analysis)
* RNA-Seq [tutorial](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/rnaseq_tutorial)
* RNA-Seq ['genome browser'](http://xena.ucsc.edu/welcome-to-ucsc-xena/)

Evolutionary Biology
------
* Still figuring out what to put here..

Data Visualization (R, python)
------
* Pathwork, an interesting way to [combine plots](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/)
* Something I want to explore better, [plotly for R and python](https://plot.ly/r/)
* The usual suspect, [ggplot2](http://t-redactyl.io/tag/ggplot2.html)

Career-oriented
------
* Establishing a laboratory book [for new PIs](https://twitter.com/samuelmehr/status/1139733291899080705)
