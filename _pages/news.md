* 01/01/2022 - Happy New Year! Our project [BiGTREE (*Bi*odiversity *G*enomics *T*raining, *R*esearch, *E*ducation and *E*xchanges)](http://bigtree-training.org/), where we have 1,000,000 USD to train LatinAmerican students starts today. Really looking forward to five years of collaboration, classes, receiving MSc/PhD students in Norway and sending Norwegians abroad.
