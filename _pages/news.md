* 26/04/2021 - We will be starting our ForBio Course [Introduction to Bioinformatics](https://www.forbio.uio.no/events/courses/2021/bioinfo_intro_2021.html)
* 10/04/2021 - I will be giving a Scan seminar on [Genome Evolution in the Scalesia group](https://www.itqb.unl.pt/events/scan-jose-cerca), to the ITQB in Lisboa, PT.
* 04/04/2021 - This week I'll be teaching my first class for the NTNU - A 2 hour lecture on Island Biogeography for undergraduates!
* 28/03/2021 - Just gave two presentations on my background and motivation to do research abroad, to the Portuguese Meeting for Biology Students - hopefully we will find some more PT Evolutionary Biologists in the making!
* 17/03/2021 - I hosted a Genomics Social Hour on [Island Adaptive Radiations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_GFcqb8fls), which was really nice! I can't take any credit, since the speakers put on an excellent show, and we had >100 participants.
* 17/02/2021 - My fellowship "Ecological speciation, polyploidy, and the rewiring of transcriptomic networks: untangling the drivers for genomic novelty and genomic functionality" was funded by the Norwegian Research Council - 1,691,000 NOK to collaborate with & visit the Gal√°pagos, Copenhagen, and UC Davis!
* 16/02/2021 - Just accepted hosting a speed-dating session on careers and paths on Evolutionary Genomics to the ENEB (Portuguese National Meeting for Biology Students) in March. Really looking forward 
* 12/02/2021 - Happy Darwin Day! I am talking at a Portuguese high-school to some 17/18 year olds about careers in science.
* 15/01/2021 - When it rains, it pours! I got two papers first-authored accepted this week (one in PeerJ, another in Methods in Ecology and Evolution). Time to celebrate!
* 10/01/2021 - Tune in for a session I am organizing soon, entitled [Evolution of those around us: Genomics of commensalism and urban evolution](https://twitter.com/IslandGenomics/status/1350007548154437633?s=19)
* 22/12/2020 - Just got a rejection on a grant application on commensalism and urban evolution in Cape Verde. It's tough, but will resubmit this until I eventually get it (since I think it's a nice project)
* 28/10/2020 - I just created the [DarwinPlants website!](https://darwin-plants.com)
* 01/10/2020 - I just got enrolled as a supervisor of two MSc students. Jaime is working on parrots & Nina will be working on snakes! Both projects involve looking at genomics (mitochondrial genomes, phylogenies, SNP-calling & popgen!)
* 01/09/2020 - See my first Rxiv paper: [Removing the bad apples: a simple bioinformatic method to improve loci-recovery in de novo RADseq data for non-model organisms](https://ecoevorxiv.org/47tka)
* 17/08/2020 - First day at my new job in Trondheim!
* **10/07/2020 - I accepted a position in the Natural History Museum in Trondheim, with [Mike Martin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WosqmUMAAAAJ), to work with the [adaptive radiation of Galapagos Scalesia](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/#/project/NFR/287327). I'll start on August 15th** 
* 25/06/2020 - the *last* paper of my PhD has been submitted. Fingers crossed!
* 05/06/2020 - I successfuly defended my PhD, entitled "On The Origin of Cryptic Species".. now I need to find myself a job!
* 29/05/2020 - My [Trial lecture is online](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/events/disputations-and-trial-lectures/proveforeslesninger/triallecture_cerca-%281%29.mp4). These are 45-minute lectures on a topic related, but not necessarily overlapping with the candidate's PhD. I got "The relevance of undescribed species for science and society, and the potential for elucidation through genomics".
* 29/05/2020 - Game on! My PhD defense [has been publicly announced](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/events/disputations-and-trial-lectures/Oliveira.html). You'll be able to hear me live via zoom.
* 11/05/2020 - Our [California Conservation Genomics Project](https://johnmuir.ucdavis.edu/2019/09/25/california-conservation-genomics-program-species-nominations-now-open/) was funded. We will be looking at signatures of urban adaptation in a black-widow species across California!
* 08/05/2020 - My Spider Comparative Genomics for the [Genomics Social Hour](https://www.calacademy.org/virtual-genomic-social-hour) is [online!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=867&v=ZWeLy7fFumg&feature=emb_logo) (begins at 14:27)
* 03/04/2020 - Tune-in for my RADseq methods talk on the Virtual Genomics Social Hour!
* 04/2020 - Currently searching/applying for post-doctoral positions!
* 03/2020 - The CalAcademy is organizing a [Virtual Genomics Social Hour](https://www.calacademy.org/virtual-genomic-social-hour)
* 03/2020 - Back *Home* - with the Pandemic we had to move back to Norway. Stay safe, everyone!
* 01/2020 - PhD Viva scheduled for the 5th of June
* 01/2020 - We got the cover! - [Evolution Volume 74, 1st Issue](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/15585646/2020/74/1)
