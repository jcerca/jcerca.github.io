Welcome! I am an evolutionary biologist, currently working as a Postdoc at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) University Museum, under [Mike Martin](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/mike.martin).

Before, I was a visiting scholar at the [Berkeley Evolab in UC Berkeley](https://nature.berkeley.edu/evolab/). I did my PhD with the [Frontiers of Evolutionary Zoology](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/about/organization/research-collections/?vrtx=unit-view&areacode=280808&lang=en) group at the University of Oslo, and my MSc at the [Centre for Functional Ecology in Coimbra](http://cfe.uc.pt/).

### Short bio

I combine genomic data (population genomics, phylogenomics, comparative genomics), together with ecological and phenotypic data from non-model organisms to understand how species evolve and adapt.

(While I work on multiple projects) I specialy on evolution on islands - see my research tab for more details.

I am open to collaboration, contact and inquiries from the general public, press or peers. Feel free to contact me from at jose.cerca (at) gmail.com

### For editors looking for reviewers for peer-review
Thanks for thinking of me! I am very happy to review manuscripts. I feel confident in /have been involved in reviewing:

Papers using RADseq for phylogenomics and population genomics; Papers using whole genome re-sequencing for phylogenomics and population genomics; Papers doing genome assembly and comparative genomics; Papers on adaptive radiation (especially on island systems)

### More about myself
I am originally from the small, cosy town of [Guarda, Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarda,_Portugal) - where I'll always have my heart. When I was 18, I moved to Coimbra to study biology at the [Universidade de Coimbra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Coimbra), and did a one-year Erasmus in [Siena, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena). I returned to Coimbra to do a MSc in Ecology and then moved to Lisboa for a 6 months stay as a technician, and eventually moved to Oslo for my PhD. I enjoy following sports (I am a big [F. C. Porto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Porto) and [SF 49ers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers) fan), politics, spending time with friends, watching series, hiking - I'd say that other than my work, I'm pretty normal!
