Hi! I am an evolutionary biologist, currently a visiting scholar (post-doc) at the [Berkeley Evolab in UC-Berkeley](https://nature.berkeley.edu/evolab/). I am awaiting for my PhD's viva which will happen in June at the University of Oslo where I was part of the [Frontiers in Evolutionary Zoology research group](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/about/organization/research-collections/?vrtx=unit-view&areacode=280808&lang=en).

During my career I have become an expert in Evolutionary Genomics, a field which combines computational biology and bioinformatics, together with genetic data from natural organisms. During the last few years I have worked at the inferface of Population genomics, Comparative Genomics and Phylogenomics, researching on adaptation (how species adapt), speciation (how species become different species), biogeography (how species move around) and parallel and convergent evolution (how different species solve similar problems).

I am open to collaborations, contactand inquiries from the general public, press or peers. Feel free to contact me from at jose.cerca (at) gmail.com
