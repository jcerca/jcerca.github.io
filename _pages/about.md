I am an evolutionary biologist, currently a visiting scholar at the [Berkeley Evolab in UC-Berkeley](https://nature.berkeley.edu/evolab/), and connected to the [Frontiers of Evolutionary Zoology](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/about/organization/research-collections/?vrtx=unit-view&areacode=280808&lang=en) group at the University of Oslo.


I combine genomic data (population genomics, phylogenomics, comparative genomics), together with ecological and phenotypic data from non-model organisms to understand how they evolve and adapt. During the last few years I have worked on adaptation (how species adapt), speciation (how species become different species), biogeography (how species move around and are distributed), and parallel and convergent evolution (how different species solve similar problems). Considering global climatic changes, as well as elevated rates of species extinction, there is an urgent need for understanding how species adapt, diversify, move around and respond to changing environments.

I am open to collaboration, contact and inquiries from the general public, press or peers. Feel free to contact me from at jose.cerca (at) gmail.com
