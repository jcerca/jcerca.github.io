I am an evolutionary biologist working with evolutionary genomics and biodiversity research. I am starting a postdoc at the University of Oslo in January 2023.

### Short bio

I combine genomic data (reference genomes, population/species-level sampling), together with ecological and phenotypic data from non-model organisms to understand how species evolve (speciate, adapt, change).

While I work on multiple projects (from Parrots to worms!), I am especially passionate about evolution on islands - as these offer excellent models of evolutionary research.

I am open to collaboration, contact and inquiries from the general public, press or peers. Feel free to contact me from at jose.cerca (at) gmail.com

### For editors looking for reviewers for peer-review
Thanks for thinking of me! I am very happy to review manuscripts. I feel confident in /have been involved in reviewing:

Papers using RADseq for phylogenomics and population genomics; Papers using whole genome re-sequencing for phylogenomics and population genomics; Papers doing genome assembly and comparative genomics; Papers on adaptive radiation (especially on island systems)

### More about myself
I am originally from the small, cosy town of [Guarda, Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarda,_Portugal) - where I'll always have my heart. I moved to Coimbra to study Biology at the [Universidade de Coimbra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Coimbra) when I was 18, and did a one-year Erasmus in [Siena, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena). I have a MSc in Ecology from U. Coimbra, and eventually moved to Oslo for my PhD, and I took a liking to Norway. Ever since my PhD I've lived/worked (>3 months) in Berkeley and Davis, Trondheim, Gal√°pagos, mainland Ecuador. On my free time, I enjoy following sports (I am a big [F. C. Porto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Porto) and the [SF 49ers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers) fan), politics, spending time with friends, watching series, hiking - I'd say that other than my work, I'm pretty normal.
