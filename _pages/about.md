Hi! I am Jos√©, an evolutionary biologist, currently a visiting scholar at the [Berkeley Evolab in UC-Berkeley](https://nature.berkeley.edu/evolab/). I am currently awaiting for my PhD's viva which will happen in June at the University of Oslo where I was part of the [Frontiers in Evolutionary Zoology research group](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/about/organization/research-collections/?vrtx=unit-view&areacode=280808&lang=en).

During my career I have developed a liking into Evolutionary Genomics, a field which combines computational biology and bioinformatics, together with genetic data from natural organisms. During the last few years I have worked at the inferface of Population genomics, Comparative genomics and Phylogenomics, with the intention of learning about adaptation (how species adapt), speciation (how species are formed), biogeography (how species move around) and parallel and convergent evolution (how different species solve similar problems).

I am open to collaborations and for contact both from the 'public' and from the press. Feel free to contact me from at jose.cerca (at) gmail.com
