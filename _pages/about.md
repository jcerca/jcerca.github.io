I am an evolutionary biologist, currently a visiting scholar (post-doc) at the [Berkeley Evolab in UC-Berkeley](https://nature.berkeley.edu/evolab/). I am awaiting for my PhD's viva which will happen in June at the University of Oslo where I was part of the [Frontiers in Evolutionary Zoology research group](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/about/organization/research-collections/?vrtx=unit-view&areacode=280808&lang=en).

I combine tools in Evolutionary Genomics (population genomics, phylogenomics, comparative genomics), a field which combines computational biology and bioinformatics, together with ecological and morphological data from natural species to understand how they evolve and adapt. During the last few years I have worked on species-adaptation (how species adapt), speciation (how species become different species), biogeography (how species move around and are distributed) and parallel and convergent evolution (how different species solve similar problems).

I am open to collaborations, contactand inquiries from the general public, press or peers. Feel free to contact me from at jose.cerca (at) gmail.com
